### Project Overview: Credit Card Transaction Simulation

The provided JavaScript code appears to simulate a credit card transaction process within a web application. The primary functionalities and structure of this project can be summarized as follows:

#### Purpose
This project aims to mimic a credit card transaction by accepting and processing an input amount, then displaying transaction details in a predefined HTML structure.

#### Components
- **HTML Structure**: The HTML layout represents a basic web page with elements such as a header, charge amount display, connection status, log responses, and a checkbox/button for log saving.
- **Styling**: The linked CSS file provides styles for the entire page, including the header, log section, buttons, and checkboxes.
- **JavaScript Functionality**:
    - **Initialization**: Defines constants and variables to manage transaction data.
    - **Event Handling**: Listens for the document to load and updates a scrollable div with a placeholder text.
    - **Message Handling**: Simulates the reception of a message (simulated as a Chrome extension message) containing an amount, processes it, and updates the HTML content accordingly.
    - **Transaction Simulation**: Constructs a simulated transaction message with pre-defined test values and updates the response message in the HTML.

#### Functions
- `displayMessage(request)`: Receives a message, processes the received amount, and updates the charge amount displayed in the HTML.
- `updateResponseMessage()`: Constructs a simulated transaction message based on the received amount and updates the response section in the HTML.

#### Purpose of Simulated Functions
The functions emulate the reception of a message (containing an amount) and the subsequent handling of this information. The received amount is processed to simulate a transaction and is displayed in the HTML as if it were the result of an actual credit card transaction.

This simulation project lacks live interaction with real credit card systems and is instead a self-contained demonstration of handling incoming transaction-like data and displaying the simulated transaction details.

Please note that this project is a simulation and does not conduct real credit card transactions or interact with live financial systems. It serves as a learning or testing environment for handling and displaying transaction-related data within a web application.
